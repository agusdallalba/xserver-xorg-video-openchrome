	- Added ChangeLog to the repository.
	- Made the DDX update the overlay if a change in surface format occured
	  while it's dimensions are still the same.
	- Made the XvMCLowLevel struct opaque (void *) and not defined in the 
	  header file. This allows for different definitions for different hardware
	- Added a HQV shadow which holds the HQV context for the Unichrome Pro. 
	  The purpose is twofold:
	  1. If someone else touched the HQV since we last used it, we can upload the
	     whole context.
	  2. We do not need to read from the HQV, which is bad because we have to 
	     halt the DMA engine to do that.
	- Added and activated mpeg deblocking for Unichrome Pro.
	- Added a number of HQV utility functions for the upcoming video engine free
	  output. These are not activated yet. (Unichrome Pro.)
	- Added HW deinterlacing functions. Deactivated, since I cannot see any visible
	  difference. (Unichrome Pro.)
