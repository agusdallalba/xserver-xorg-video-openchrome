Description: X.Org X server -- VIA display driver
 OpenChrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers
 for the VIA UniChrome video chipsets.
 .
 Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an
 experimental branch of the unichrome cvs code, this is a continued development
 of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which
 also incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets.
 .
 Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently
 been ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if
 you wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free
 and open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver.
